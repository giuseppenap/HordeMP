# HordeMP
This Project is a portfolio Piece in the Works. <br>
It's a Horde Game that can be played online with friends via Steam. <br>
It is meant to test my development skills in Unreal Engine 5 by creating a Game that combines COD: Zombies, Souls Games and Vampire Survivors. <br>
This project is supposed to showcase my ability to combine different Aspects of Development like Feature, Tech Art and Game Design. <br>
This project contains various Asset Packs to visually enhance the project but no third Party code or plugins.
